<h2>What this visualization does:</h2>
Our visualization includes a plot with an x-axis of time and
two y-axes. One y-axis is the stock values of a company,
and the other is its popularity in google trends.This plot
graphs changes in stock prices over time as well as changes in
search popularity.
</p>

<p>
<h2>How to use this visualization:</h2>
You can select the company for which to display data by using the menu to the
left. To examine the specific data of a specific point, mouse over
it. The date, and values will be displayed to the
right. Additionally, if you are curious about what events were occurring at a
specific point, clicking on the point will display relevent New York Times
articles from around that time.
</p>

<p>
<h2>How the data was prepared:</h2>
We obtained the stock data we used for this visualization from Yahoo, and
the trends data from Google Trends. When the data didn't specify when the
day of the month as part of the date, we arbitrarily set the date to the first
day of the month so that the data could still be displayed.
