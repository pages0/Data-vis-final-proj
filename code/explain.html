<h1>Project explaination</h1>

<p>
What the visualization means:
Our visualization includes a plot with an x-axis of time and
two y-axes. One y-axis is the stock values of a company,
and the other is its popularity in google trends.This plot
graphs changes in stock prices over time as well as changes in the
social media metric.
</p>

<p>
How to use the visualization:
The data being displayed can be selected from by using the menu to the
left. To examine the specific value of a specific point, mouse over
that point. The date, and values will be displayed to the
right. Additionally, if you are curious about what was going on at a
specific point, clicking on the point will get relevent New York Times
articles from around that time.
</p>

<p>
How the data was prepared:
We got the stock data we used for this visualization from Yahoo, and
the trends data from google. When the data didn't specify when the
day of the month as part of the date, we added the first day of the
month so that we could map the trends
