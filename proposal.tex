\begin{enumerate}
  \item[Purpose] 
    
    Introduction paragraph:
    
    Our visualization will be a display of stock data for a company
    overlaid with data relating to how often that company is mentioned
    in social media, or search for on the internet. We plan to let
    users look over various time frames, and highlight when either the
    stock price or mentions increase quickly. Possibly look at if it
    differs in location.

    What questions will users be able to answer?
    
    Hopefully users will be able to understand better the effects
    stocks have on social media, and social media on
    stocks. Potentially be able to understand which precedes the
    others, and in what types of situations will one come before the
    other? When social media comes first, what effect does it have?
    Looking at location data, we predict that where it is trending
    won't matter in terms of how it will effect the stock price.

    Also, does publicity tend to be good or bad?

    What could those answers be? Best guess?
    
    We predict that around the same time stock plumet that social
    media mentions will increase.

    What makes these questions complex enough to require a
    visualization?

    Lot of data, somewhat hard to look at all of it, and pair
    together. Unless you look at them overlapped, its difficult to
    find the relation.
    
  \item[Design]
    
    Explain how visualization will work:


    Include visualization attached

  \item[Techniques]

    We will be using Google trends data, and Yahoo's API to look at
    past stock data. We also will investigate using redit, facebook
    twitter and new york times data, but we currently have access to the Google
    trends, and Yahoo data.
